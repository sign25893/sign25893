I've been involved in development since childhood, from low-level controller programming, to game creation. I managed to work in different companies as a programmer and designer, and during a break for a couple of days even as a store clerk. 
At the moment I am engaged in the development of automation systems, most of my projects I can not put in the public domain, because I forbid the privacy policy of my company. However, some parts and personal projects are in my profile.

Welcome to my shalash!
