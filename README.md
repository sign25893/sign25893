### 🚀 About Me

I'm an embedded systems developer with a focus on **ESP32**, **C**, and **Python**. I’ve been programming since childhood — from low-level microcontroller code to game development and full-stack applications.

Over the years, I’ve worked in different roles: **developer**, **designer**, and even a **store clerk** for a short break — but my heart always stayed in tech.

Currently, I’m developing industrial and home **automation systems**, though many of my projects are private due to company policies. But some personal and open contributions are available here on my GitHub.

> **Welcome to my _shalash_ (digital hut)!**

### 💡 Current Focus

🔧 Working on a **universal LVGL UI builder** for ESP32 — directly in your browser  
⚡ Featuring **real-time syncing**, **custom actions**, and drag-n-drop interface  
📲 It will allow you to design, test, and flash interfaces on the fly

### 🧠 Always Learning

- Automation of technical processes with ESP32  
- Advanced C & LVGL usage  
- Web technologies: `WebSockets`, `HTML/CSS/JS`, and `Python (FastAPI)`
